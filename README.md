# Keylogger
For my final project in class, I choose to create a keylogger that captures keyboard inputs from my own Windows desktop. I also added a GUI that has functioning buttons to start and stop keylogging, clear the current log, and save the current log as a .txt file. I have attached the .py file and a .txt file containing the full code used!
